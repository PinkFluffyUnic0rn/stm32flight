STM32 Flight controller
=========================

Implementing a flight controller for a small quadcopter. UAV is
controlled through ELRS transmitter.

What's done:
* single roll/pitch PID control loop, stabilization using gyroscope
(accro mode) readings.
* double roll/pitch PID control loop, stabilization using
accelerometer/gyroscope readings.
* yaw stabilization using gyroscope readings.
* yaw stabilization using magnetometer/gyroscope readings.
* acceleration stabilization using accelerometer readings.
* configuration through wi-fi.
* altitude hold.
* telemetry through eLRS.
